                    <p class="deatiled-view-card-description">
                      <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river
                         in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah 
                         Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. 
                         The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a
                          guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>

                      <p>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other 
                        phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been 
                        completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, 
                        which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project 
                        employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to 
                        the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.</p>
                      
                      <p>The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art 
                        in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. It is regarded by many 
                        as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 
                        7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007)
                         initiative.</p>

                        <p class="deatiled-view-card-description">
                            <p>The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Darbar Sahib and Sri Harmandir Sahib, 
                            is located in the Indian city of Amritsar in India. The temple is the 
                            principal place of worship for the Sikh people, allowing equal entry to 
                            all casts, creeds, and races. The temple is part of a larger complex organized 
                            around an artificial pond, or sarovar, on which it appears to float, connected 
                            by a long causeway to the surrounding structures. The Golden Temple of India's 
                            more formal name, Harmandir, comes from the combination of its architect, 
                            Guru Arjan Sahib, with "Hari" or "god" and "mandre," meaning "house." As it is 
                            alternately called Darbar, meaning "assembly hall," The original structure was 
                            built in the late 1500s. However, it was reconstructed after damage from Afghan 
                            invaders, with its surface covered in gilt and gold foil. This covering has granted 
                            it its more general name, the Golden Temple.</p>

                            <p>The first Harmandir Sahib was built in 1604 by Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, who 
                              symbolically had it placed on a lower level so that even the humblest had to step 
                              down to enter. He also included entrances on all four sides, signifying that it was open 
                              to worshippers of all castes and creeds. The foundation stone was laid by Mian Mīr, a Sufi
                               Muslim saint from Lahore (now in Pakistan). The temple was destroyed several times by Afghan
                                invaders and was finally rebuilt by 1776.</p> 

                                <p>The temple is notable for its blend of Mughal 
                                (Islamic) and Rajput (Hindu) architectural styles. During the reign (1801–39) of Maharaja
                                 Ranjit Singh, who founded the Sikh empire, the lower stories of the central temple were 
                                 faced with white marble inlaid with designs made of precious gems, the interior walls 
                                 were adorned with frescoes and mirror and gold leaf decorations, and the upper stories 
                                 were overlaid with gilded copper panels. The structure thus became known as the Golden 
                                 Temple.</p>

                            <p>Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a 
                              royal residence. It is located in Mysore, Karnataka, India. It used to be the 
                              official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. 
                              The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. 
                              Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of the Palaces', and there are seven 
                              palaces including this one. However, the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the 
                              one within the new fort.</p>

                              <p>The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru 
                                (literally, "citadel"). The first palace inside the Old Fort was built in the 
                                14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The Old 
                                Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was 
                                built of stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 
                                1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the current structure is also 
                                known as the New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the most famous tourist 
                                attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than three million annual
                                 visitors as on 2014.</p>

                          <p>Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva. It is located in 
                            Vishwanath Gali, in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The temple is a Hindu pilgrimage site 
                            and is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines. The presiding deity is known by the names Vishwanath 
                            and Vishweshwara (IAST: Viśvanātha and Viśveśvara), meaning Lord of the Universe.</p>

                          <p>The original temple, called the Adi Vishveshwar Temple, was demolished by Mohammad of Ghor during 
                            his invasion of India. Subsequently, the template was rebuilt by Man Singh I and Todar Mal under Emperor 
                            Akbar. According to several historical accounts, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered the demolition
                             of the Hindu temple in 1669. Subsequently, in 1678, the Gyanvapi Mosque was built on its site, but 
                             Hindu pilgrims continued to visit the remnants of the temple. The current structure was constructed
                              on an adjacent site by the Maratha ruler Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore in 1780.</p>

                          <p>In 2021, a major redevelopment of the temple complex was completed, and the Kashi Vishwanath Dham 
                            Corridor connecting the Ganga river with the temple was inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi, leading 
                            to a many-fold increase in visitors. It has become one of the most visited Hindu temples in India, 
                            with an average 45,000 pilgrims per day in 2023.The total assets of the temple, were estimated to be 
                            more than ₹6 crores in 2024.</p>
